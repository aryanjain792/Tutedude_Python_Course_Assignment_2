The Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd: is written to check whether a number is odd or even. First the integer number is taken as input from the user then using the modulud operator it is checked whether the remainder is zero or not. If the remainder is zero then the number is even otherwise odd.

The Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop: is done to find the sum of intergers from 1 to 50. First a variable named total_sum is initialized to zero. Then for loop is started for range 1 to 51 and every number is added to total_sum. Hence we get the output as tottal sum.
